# 🔧 QualityReport Fixed!

## ✅ Issue: 'QualityReport' object has no attribute 'get'

**Problem:** Code was treating `QualityReport` (a dataclass) like a dictionary

---

## 🔧 The Fix

**File:** `backend/app/services/podcast_service.py` (Line 106)

### **Before (WRONG):**
```python
'quality_score': result.get('quality_report', {}).get('overall_score')
# ❌ Trying to use .get() on a dataclass object
```

### **After (CORRECT):**
```python
quality_report = result.get('quality_report')
quality_score = quality_report.overall_score if quality_report else None
# ✅ Accessing dataclass attribute directly
```
