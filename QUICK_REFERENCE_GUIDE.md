# Quick Reference Guide - What's Actually Working

## TL;DR - Current State

**DEPLOYED:** ✅ Yes (Railway + Vercel)  
**WORKING:** ⚠️ Partially  
**AUDIO:** ❌ No  
**SCRIPT QUALITY:** ⚠️ Poor (template text issues)

---

## 1. DATA COLLECTION - 90% Complete ✅

### What Works:
- ✅ Wikipedia API integration (2-5s response)
- ✅ Location service (1-3s response)
- ✅ Content aggregation
- ✅ Caching (15 min TTL)
- ✅ Error handling

### What's Missing:
- ❌ Atlas Obscura integration (coded but not active)
- ❌ Standout detection (coded but not integrated)
- ❌ Deep historical research
- ❌ Cultural context gathering
- ❌ Content quality scoring

### Data Sources Active:
1. **Wikipedia** - Article content, facts, categories
2. **Location Service** - Coordinates, demographics, climate

### Data Sources Available But Not Used:
3. **Perplexity AI** - Could do deep research (only used for script)
4. **Atlas Obscura** - Unusual/standout content (code exists)
5. **Standout Detector** - Quality scoring (code exists)

---

## 2. SCRIPT CREATION - 70% Complete ⚠️

### What Works:
- ✅ Narrative engine (5 templates)
- ✅ Script assembly (4 formats)
- ✅ Quality control framework (5 checks)
- ✅ TTS optimization
- ✅ Style adaptation

### What's Broken:
- ❌ Perplexity AI returns template text ("Let's continue...")
- ❌ Incomplete responses
- ❌ Inconsistent quality
- ❌ Poor user experience

### Script Generation Flow:
```
Content Data (3-8s)
  ↓
Perplexity AI (5-10s) ← PROBLEM HERE
  ↓
Narrative Engine (1-2s)
  ↓
Script Assembly (1-2s)
  ↓
Quality Control (1-2s) ← May not be active
  ↓
Final Script (with template text issues)
```

### Systems Coded But Not Fully Active:
- Quality checks (implemented but may not run)
- Standout podcast format (exists but needs better content)
- Personalized format (needs user preferences connected)

---

## 3. AUDIO CREATION - 10% Complete ❌

### What's Coded (But Disabled):
- ✅ Multi-tier TTS system (6 providers)
- ✅ Audio processing pipeline (4 stages)
- ✅ Delivery system (CDN, streaming)
- ✅ Quality assurance framework

### Why It's Not Working:
**Line 141-145 in podcast_service.py:**
```python
# Step 4: Generate audio (90%)
log_step(4, "Preparing audio generation (skipped for now)", "RUNNING")
# TODO: Integrate audio generation service
# For now, we'll skip audio generation
# audio_url = await self._generate_audio(script.content)
# podcast.audio_url = audio_url
```

**Status:** Completely commented out

- Festival - No API key needed

**PREMIUM (Need API keys):**

## Code vs Reality

| System | Lines Coded | Lines Active | % Active |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Data Collection** | ~1,500 | ~1,350 | 90% |
| **Script Creation** | ~3,600 | ~2,500 | 70% |
| **Audio System** | ~2,700 | ~0 | 0% |
| **User Preferences** | ~3,600 | ~0 | 0% |
| **Standout Detection** | ~1,500 | ~0 | 0% |
| **Recommendations** | ~2,500 | ~0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | ~15,400 | ~3,850 | **25%** |

**Only 25% of coded features are actually active in production!**

## What Users Experience Now

1. **Register/Login** ✅ Works perfectly
2. **Request podcast** ✅ Works
3. **Wait 10-20 seconds** ✅ Works
4. **Receive script** ⚠️ Works but poor quality
5. **See template text** ❌ Bad experience
6. **No audio file** ❌ Missing core feature
7. **Can't listen** ❌ Defeats purpose

## Priority Issues

### HIGH PRIORITY (Breaks user experience):

1. **Script Quality - Template Text**
   - Problem: Perplexity returns "Let's continue..." repeatedly
   - Impact: Users get incomplete, unprofessional scripts
   - Fix: Improve prompts, add validation, implement retry
   - Time: 2-4 hours

2. **No Audio Generation**
   - Problem: Audio code completely disabled
   - Impact: Users can't listen to podcasts
   - Fix: Uncomment code, use free TTS
   - Time: 30 minutes (free) or 2 hours (premium)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Missing value):

3. **Standout Detection Not Integrated**
   - Problem: Code exists but not connected
   - Impact: All content treated equally, no filtering
   - Fix: Integrate with data collection
   - Time: 2-3 hours

4. **User Preferences Not Connected**
   - Problem: Sophisticated system coded but not used
   - Impact: No personalization
   - Fix: Connect to script generation
   - Time: 3-4 hours

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have):

5. **Advanced Features Inactive**
   - Behavioral learning
   - Recommendation engine
   - Quality scoring
   - Multiple data sources
