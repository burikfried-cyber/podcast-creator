## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### **If you see: "No LLM available"**
- Check `.env` has `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
- Restart backend server
- Check logs for initialization message

### **If generation is still <1 second:**
- Check logs for "generating_with_perplexity"
- If missing, Perplexity isn't being called
- Verify API key is correct in `.env`

### **If you get API errors:**
- Check Perplexity API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Check API status: https://status.perplexity.ai

### **If content is still generic:**
- Check logs for "real_content_fetched"
- Verify Wikipedia is being called
- Check script content in database
