# 🔧 PodcastScript Model Fixed!

## ✅ Issue: 'PodcastScript' object has no attribute 'title'

**Problem:** The `PodcastScript` model was missing `title` and `description` attributes

---

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### **1. Added Missing Attributes**
**File:** `backend/app/services/narrative/models.py`

```python
@dataclass
class PodcastScript:
    # ... existing fields ...
    title: str = ""  # ✅ ADDED
    description: str = ""  # ✅ ADDED
```

---

### **2. Set Title & Description**
**File:** `backend/app/services/narrative/script_assembly.py`

```python
# Generate title and description
location = content_data.get('location', 'Unknown Location')
title = f"Discover {location}"
description = f"An engaging podcast exploring the fascinating stories and secrets of {location}"

# Build final podcast script
podcast_script = PodcastScript(
    # ... other fields ...
    title=title,  # ✅ ADDED
    description=description  # ✅ ADDED
)
```

## 🚀 What to Do Now

### **Backend should auto-reload!**

If you see:
```
